# Andromeda Mariana for VSCode

**Andromeda** `1.6.1` theme with the **Mariana** scheme(color syntax highlight) for those who like to have the Mariana scheme just like Sublime Text.

> **NOTE**: This theme includes a variant with italic keywords that looks great with fonts like Operator Mono or Catograph Mono
